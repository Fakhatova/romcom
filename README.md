-   When the  **Make Your Own Cover**  button is clicked, the form is shown and the main view is hidden.
-   When the  **View Saved Covers**  button is clicked, the saved covers area is shown and the main cover is hidden.
-   When the  **Home Button** is clicked, only the home view is shown.
-   On the make your own cover form view, users can fill out the four input fields and click the  **Make My Book** button. The submitted data is saved so that future random covers can use the user-created data.

-   When the user clicks the   **Save Cover**  button the current cover is added to the saved covers section.
-   If the user  clicks the   **Save Cover**  button more than once on a single cover, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates).
-   When the user clicks the   **Showed Saved Covers** button the saved covers section is displayed.
- From the saved covers view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted
