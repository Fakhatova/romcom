# RomCom

#### Description
Welcome to RomCom! An application where users can generate random images, titles, and taglines to make their very own book cover! Users can also upload their own image, text and save them to create their own collection of spicy RomComs! 
#### Visual side
-   When the page loads, the user will see a cover with a randomly selected image, title and tagline.
   ![make own cover form](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/romcom/romcom-home.png)
-   When the  **Make Your Own Cover**  button is clicked, the form is shown and the main view is hidden.
-   When the  **View Saved Covers**  button is clicked, the saved covers area is shown and the main cover is hidden.
-   When the  **Home Button** is clicked, only the home view is shown.
-   On the make your own cover form view, users can fill out the four input fields and click the  **Make My Book** button. The submitted data is saved so that future random covers can use the user-created data.

-   The page view changes back to the main home view.
-   The newly created cover image, title and tagline are displayed in the main view.
![saved cover page](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/romcom/romcom-saved.png)
-   When the user clicks the   **Save Cover**  button the current cover is added to the saved covers section.
-   If the user  clicks the   **Save Cover**  button more than once on a single cover, it will still only be saved once (no duplicates).
-   When the user clicks the   **Showed Saved Covers** button the saved covers section is displayed.
- From the saved covers view, if a user double clicks a saved poster, it will be deleted

Future additions to this application will include:

- A preview of the user-created cover before adding to the collection
- A pop up error when an incomplete cover is submitted
