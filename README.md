# RomCom

#### Description
Welcome to RomCom! An application where you are able to generate your own spicy, seductive book covers! Choose from pre-selected covers to save, or if you're feeling creative, create your very own by using images, titles, and taglines of your choosing. 
#### Visual side
-   When you visit [RomCom](https://fakhatova.github.io/romcom/) you will land on the home page with a randomly selected cover image, title and tagline.
   ![make own cover form](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/romcom/romcom-home.png)
-   Perhaps you want to scroll through some covers first to get an idea of what you're looking for! Just click the **Show New Random Cover** and you may come across something you like! 
-   But maybe you just aren't finding what tickles your fancy.  If this is the case, you can click the  **Make Your Own Cover** if you want to dive into making your own and get those creative juices flowing! 
![make own cover form](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/romcom/romcom-form.png)
-   On this form page, you have the option to fill out the input fields and click the  **Make My Book** button. The submitted data is saved so that future random covers can use the user-created data.
-   Voila! Your newly created cover image, title, and tagline are now displayed in the main view.
![saved cover page](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/assets/romcom/romcom-saved.png)
-   From here, you have the option of hitting that  **Save Cover**  button, and BAM! Your favorites are added to the saved covers section.
-   Don't worry about getting click happy and saving a cover more than once, we made sure that this doesn't happen! 
-   If you would like to view all of your beautiful saved covers, just head on over to the **Saved Covers** section. 
-   Now if you're thinking, wow what if I don't actually love that cover anymore?? No problem! Just double click any cover and *POOF* it is out of there!
